<p>
A test case used in the big number multiplication problem can be any number.  
Because we are talking about big numbers, the product should be larger than standard data types (2^8, 2^16, 2^32, 2^64). </p>

<p>In this project a test case is composed of two one-dimensional fixed-sized arrays of bytes, where each of them present a multiplication factor. The aim
of the algorithm is to multiply the numbers and return a result. 

For the Java programs the test case is declared with<br>

<center>
<code> byte[] firstFactor = new byte[n1];</code> <br>
<code> byte[] secondFactor = new byte[n2];</code> <br>
</center>

where <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are the sizes of an arrays to be used in multiplication.
